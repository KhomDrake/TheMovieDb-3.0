      "content": "Life for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is complicated thanks to his dual life as Spider-Man and the challenges of being in High School. Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in “Spider-Man: No Way Home”.\r\n\r\nTaking place where “Spider-Man: Far From Home” ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.\r\n\r\nAs if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.\r\n\r\nDesperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).\r\n\r\nStrange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.\r\n\r\nAs more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.\r\n\r\nThe film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.\r\n\r\nWhile there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.\r\n\r\nThere is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.\r\n\r\n4 stars out of 5",

Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.\r\n\r\nA heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.\r\n\r\nA memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.\"\r\n\r\nRating: A",

And -Speaking- of which, in our -{ OWN }- breathtakingly ravishing universe unfortunately, that particular proposition is likely to be a **-FAR CRY-** at best ; given the Academy's characteristic, and seemingly perpetual \"Stiff Upper Lip\" type of attitude towards the 'Superhero-Supervillain' genre, in general. However ; with 'Black Panther' ( 2018 ) and 'Joker' ( 2019 ) having -BOTH- been nominated for \"That... -{ Most }- Coveted Cinematic Prize ...Of All \", the Best Picture Oscar ; I believe that things are, thankfully 🙏, albeit -{ Slowly }-, **changing for the better.**\r\n\r\nYeah, so I'm er, \"Officially\" dubbing this \"An Easter ( - E g g - ) Movie Released At Christmas\", because it -well and truly- does reveal itself as **\"The Movie Of A 1,000 Beautiful Surprises\" . . . .** and so much, much, much, more. { And as I recently changed my review classification from 'Spoiler-free' to 'Spoiler', there is of course, a glaring \"Little\" reference to ( one ) of the two -most- THRILLING surprises of the picture ( by far ) }.

      "content": "_Spider-Man: No Way Home_ isn’t without its flaws, but it is mostly exactly what it’s advertised to be. The film doesn’t necessarily redefine the, “With great power comes great responsibility,” aspect for Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, but it without a doubt gives the MCU version of Spider-Man his version of that principle.\r\n\r\n_No Way Home_ is a nostalgic extravaganza that exceeds expectations and is a perfect and satisfying bookend for the first three Tom Holland _Spider-Man_ movies.\r\n\r\n**Full review**: https://boundingintocomics.com/2021/12/18/spider-man-no-way-home-riding-the-nostalgia-train/",

      "content": "Long awaited and very conspiricized, **'Spider-man:No way Home'** Lives up and surpasses hype, The introduction of charcters once thought cordened off into the MCU, came both as a shock and as an eventual certainty. The Pleathora of indephth easter eggs creates awonderful viewing for the spider-man fan but alienates the casual none MCU fanatic viewers. The plot is dense not in fault but in advantage, it crams in expectation with suitable comedy and light heartedness. The director created a a comprehensive journey of emotion with several troughs and many peaks leaving a sense of WOAH at the end.\r\n\r\nOverall, **'Spider-man NWH'** is a Marvel Maniac's Heaven but can ruin marvel experiences for the uniformed viewers spoiling previous films and enjoyment of them. This is not a stand-alone film and for some this amazing but for many of those seeking to enter the universe this is not at all suitable. This and the poorly grand soundtrack make it 4.5 stars.",

      "content": "Wow! Loved it!\r\n\r\nI'd recommend not reading any reviews if you plan to watch it - I didn't and I'm sure glad I didn't! Spoilers inbound!\r\n\r\nWhere to begin? I was not expecting to love this film as much as I do! It surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that I'd say it beats <em>'Avengers: Endgame'</em> as my favourite production from the MCU. This is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most I've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.\r\n\r\nThe cast are all outstanding, it's ace how they work everyone in from previous iterations of <em>'Spider-Man'</em> - even away from the main universe. Seeing Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire together onscreen as Peter Parker is tremendous. The film does it in the perfect way, at no point does it feel forced or needless and the humour between the trio is excellent; in fact, the whole film is funny when it intends to be.\r\n\r\nZendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon (his best showing of the trilogy), Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei also add positives things to this 2021 film. Jamie Foxx, Alfred Molina and, most pleasing for me, Willem Dafoe all reprise their characters from past releases and are all a joy. I'm a fan of Dafoe so was particularly happy to see him reappear.\r\n\r\nOnto what we see onscreen. The plot is great and I wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that I had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. The pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot.\r\n\r\nThis really is top tier Marvel! Would watch again, would recommended etc. Awesome!",

      "content": "This is another Spider Man for kids which for me is a wee bit unfortunate. I would very much have liked a Peter Parker / Spider Man that behaved like a real superhero instead of this naïve kid who constantly thinks he knows better than the grown ups and, of course, constantly bungles things up.\r\n\r\nIn addition I was not too thrilled about the story itself where Spider Man right at the beginning is framed as the bad guy. I know, I know, it is rather consistent with the original comics but Hollywood do not hesitate so change things if they feel like it so why not make a good change for once?\r\n\r\nThe good thing about this movie is the special effects. They are quite cool. Especially the parts in this weird space where Doctor Strange and Spider Man dukes it out. Unfortunately that is pretty much it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie is really dragged down by the childish and stupid behavior of Peter Parker. Him being a real idiot and constantly trying to change the spell was just cringe worthy. Then he continues screwing things up because he do not want notorious criminals to go back to their real place because they will actually die there. Typical Hollywood sob story. Despite what that dumb bitch said towards the end, yes Peter Parker you did something wrong, you screwed up big time and the wrong people died because of it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that was really annoying throughout the movie was listening to that moron Jonah Jameson from The Daily Bugle. He was spewing almost as much fake news as CNN and it just pissed me off every time he was on screen.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame really. One would have thought that, given that they already did the young and immature Spider Man in Spider Man: Far From Home, they could have made him more experienced and mature in this one. You know, character advancement.\r\n\r\nInstead they just piled on the childish, naïve and immature behavior with a good dose of juvenile jokes making what, with some actual intelligent script writing, could have been a great movie with all those cool special effects (and I really do like Doctor Strange) to be one just barely watchable.",

      "content": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is like the proverbial blind squirrel that finds a nut every now and then, except that it doesn’t so much find them as it steals them from another squirrel’s hoard. The massive combined gravitas generated by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx would be enough to save any other movie; the problem is that this film is not theirs to save, and it’s barely a film at all to begin with – it’s more like the superhero equivalent of that Pink Panther movie they made with spare parts from previous Pink Panther movies.\r\n\r\nIf I want Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, why not just revisit 2002’s Spider-Man? Similarly, if I have a hankering for Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, why not just rewatch 2004’s Spider-Man 2? The latter was, according to Roger Ebert, “the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with \"Superman\"”. How the mighty have fallen. It’s great to see Dafoe and Molina sharing screen time, but once the novelty – or rather the nostalgia – wears off, we are left with only a reminder of how comparatively superior Sam Raimi’s trilogy was, as well as a testament of how downhill things have gone since then.\r\n\r\nWhen Molina finally arrives, following an excruciatingly dumb, seemingly endless first half hour, he does so like a godsend; unfortunately, as much as we welcome the company of someone with a gleam of intelligence in his eyes, Doc Ock’s edge has been dulled by poor stylistic choices – first, his mechanical tentacles are 100% computer-generated (as opposed to Spider-Man 2, which used CGI to enhance, but not fully replace, a set of prop tentacles), and second, Molina was digitally de-aged (as was Dafoe), though in this case, unlike for example The Irishman, the unintended uncanny valley effect might have been a blessing in disguise; after all, Doc Ock is supposed to be a comic book villain, so that grotesqueness actually becomes him.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, everything and everyone endemic to the MCU Spider-Man is as flat and artificial as cardboard (our sympathy inevitably lies with the villains because, goblins and octopuses though they may be, they remain at all times more human – and certainly have a cleverer sense of humor – than any of the heroes with the exception of Tobey Maguire, and while Spider-Man may prevail over Norman Osborne, Dafoe totally obliterates Holland in terms of acting); at the same time, all the best parts are almost exclusively lifted from the work – and not even the best work at that – of a much more talented filmmaker. To put it bluntly, Spider-Man: No Way Home has absolutely no reason for being.",
